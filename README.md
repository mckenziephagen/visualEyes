# Project Description
Eye fixation directly impacts data quality in psychophysics and MRI experiments, making it a critical variable for vision scientists to control. Currently, most data quality inspections happen after the experiments, often leading to the exclusion of low-quality data. If fixation could be monitored in "real time" during the experiment, researchers could enhance data quality by communicating directly with participants. However, a user-friendly toolbox for this purpose is currently lacking. In this project, we aim to develop a Python package that provides clear and intuitive visualizations of eye-tracking data, helping both researchers and participants better understand and improve the quality of data being collected.

This package has been developed and tested on MacOS. Support for alternative OSs is a future goal. 

# Setup Instructions
1. Downlaod and install Eyelink Developers Kit by signing up for a (free) [Eyelink account](https://www.sr-research.com/support/member.php?action=register) and following the [install instructions for your OS](https://www.sr-research.com/support/thread-13.html). 

2. Clone our repository.
`git clone git@github.com:baharsener/visualEyes.git`

3. Create a Conda environment with our dependencies.
`conda env create -f environment.yml`
